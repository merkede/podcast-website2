I'm a former autism researcher, Associate Professor, and National Institutes of Health-funded Principal Investigator, who transitioned from academic research into data science. I am also a co-developer of the `palmerpenguins`, `distill`, and `blogdown` R packages, as well an author and international keynote speaker.
